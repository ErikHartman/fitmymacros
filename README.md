### Web-scraping

Written in Python. Webscrapes: <a href="https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/">https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/recipedb/</a> for all recipes. Stores data in SQL database.

### Application

The idea is the following: input the macros (protein, fat and carbs) you want for a meal, and the application queries the local database for a recipe which fits your macros.
It then shows the needed ingredients and the instructions for that recipe. Simply click "next" or "previous" to generate another recipe from the query list.
