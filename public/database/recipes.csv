If it39s obviously too dry make a small indent in the dough and add a couple tablespoons more water and work it inches If it39s too sticky toss a little flour on the surface and work it inches You can tell when it39s right if you pick it up by one side and it very slowly stretches on its own. It39s right when it feels really nice to work.
5. Now the fun part. Here39s where you get your therapy. Kneed the dough for a full five minutes. Fold it. Turn it. Push it. Punch it. Really work it. If you don39t cheat on this part you39ll have a really nice consistency in your bread.
6. After your five minutes of fun form it into a little mound cut an X in the top with a knife and pop it in an oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let it sit in a warm place for 23 hours or until doubled in size.
7. Heat your oven to about 400F When dinner is about 30 minutes away turn your dough out on your work surface punch it down and kneed it for a minute. Divide it in half with a knife and form two mounds. Oil a cookie sheet or large baking tray. Stretch your dough into a 1618 inch round. It will be about inches thick. Don39t worry about getting it perfect. Just stretch it however you like.
8. Pop the first one in the oven for about 15 minutes or until golden. Remove the tray and turn the flat bread bottom up to cool just a bit. Form another round and bake the second one while you enjoy the first. You39ll need the second
9. You can slice this flat bread if you like but it39s much more fun if you just tear it apart This easy bread recipe goes great with stews soups salads beans meats pastas almost anything."

4. Filling If you have a food processor use it it39s ideal for this filling. Cube the hard cheese add the soft cheese and process until wellmixed but some chunks remain. Add the eggs flour and seasonings and pulse just to mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use.
5. If you don39t have a food processor grate the hard cheese and beat in the soft cheese and eggs. Continue beating adding the flour and seasonings. Refrigerate until ready to use.
6. Shaping and Baking After the dough has risen turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half you39ll be making two loaves and cut a small 1ounce piece of dough off of each half. Round all four pieces of dough into balls and let them rest covered for 15 minutes.
7. Roll each large ball into a 10 to 12inch circle. Place one circle into a lightly greased small pie tin 8 or 9inch round cake pan or onto a lightly greased or parchmentlined baking sheet. Dollop half of the cheese mixture into the middle of the circle and pull the dough up around the cheese folding and pinching it and 34pleating34 it into a topknot. Leave a small hole in the very center of the knot and place the small ball in this hole. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Cover the loaves and let them rise for 45 minutes or longer they39ll look puffy but not doubled in size. If the pleats have opened pinch them shut.
8. Bake the loaves in a preheated 375F oven for 15 minutes then lower the temperature to 350F and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes. When finished the loaves will be golden brown and the middle should feel set. Tent the loaves with aluminum foil after 15 minutes if they seem to be browning too quickly. Remove the loaves from the oven and allow them to cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing. Slice the bread into wedges and serve it warm or at room temperature.

Simmer finely chopped onions in butter and chicken broth until the onion is translucent add the cooled cabbage salt and pepper. Let simmer until heated. Stir in the cream cheese and dill or substitute caraway seeds if you prefer.
2. Instant Potato and Cheese Filling Sautee the onion and butter in a small pot until the onion is translucent. Add enough water based on the instant mashed potato package directions I would guess but every brand is different and add the chives. Once the water has boiled remove the pot from the heat and add the potato flakes cheese and cream cheese.

Cook until all of the pink is gone.
4. Hunters seasoning recipe Make as much or as little as you want using this ratio. This will make more than the 3 tablespoons amount but I don39t know what the ratio would be for exactly that amount. I always make a jar full and keep it on hand since it39s a good general meat seasoning for beef or poultry. 2 teaspoons Marjoram 1 teaspoons peppercorn 1 teaspoons caraway teaspoons garlic powder 1 teaspoons onion powder 1 teaspoons Allspice to taste Cloves to taste 1 crushed bay leaf 1 teaspoons Juniper berries A difficult thing to find you can substitute this by adding a few shots of gin to the ground beef while kneading gives it a great flavor and all the alcohol will cook out."

1. For making the dough
2. Sift the flour with the salt onto a smooth clean surface.
3. Start adding the mixture of the liquids into the pile of flour in small amounts trying to incorporate the liquid into as much flour as possible each time.
4. After a while all the flour will be moistened keep adding the liquid in small amounts kneading the dough very vigorously after each time.
5. The dough might seem soggy right after you add the mixture but after you beat it for about minute it takes in the moisture out and more has to be added actually.
6. Keep adding the liquid until the dough becomes mixed throughout very evenly soft enough to manage but resilient to the touch and very stretchy. I usually have 1 or 2 ounces left of the water mixture after the dough is done.
7. Roll the dough into a ball wrap in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for about 3040 minutes.
8. For the filling to save time you can load all the ingredients into a good food processor with a meatcutting blade and ground them evenly but not too finely.
9. Add seasonings to taste.
10. Now you are ready for the fun part.
11. To assemble pelmeni first you have to make thinly rolled circles of dough.
12. You may roll out large portions of dough and cut the circles out with a glass or roll out the pieces of dough separately.
13. The dough should be very thin approximately 1/32 of an inch and look translucent.
14. While one person is making the circles the others can be putting the filling by tablespoons onto the middle of each circle and sealing the meat tightly.
15. Fold the circle over in half squeeze the edges together all the way around and gradually pinch the edge down as you would on a pie crust until it looks like a braid.
16. To make the process go faster you can use Pelmeni mold.
17. When you are wrapping please make sure there are no holes in the dough if there are holes the meat tends to be hard after cooking.
18. As you are making the pelmeni put them onto a flourdusted plate and keep dusting between layers so they dont stick together.
19. To cook the pelmeni bring a large pot of salted water or broth for better flavor to a boil and load you pelmeni into the pot.
20. They will be ready when they float to the top.
21. Take the pelmeni out with a strainer and serve hot drizzled in butter with lemon juice vinegar and sour cream in separate dishes to be used as a garnish.
22. You could also add a small salad made of coarsely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers in sour cream to add some refreshing color and a burst of vitamins.
23. If you feel you have made too many pelmeni feel free to freeze them before they are cooked they keep in a freezer for a very long time."

2. Pour evenly over your cake pieces and place bowl in fridge for a few hours or overnight covered. The more cake pieces you use for the inside the denser and heavier the cake will be. The Russian cakes I remember weighed several pounds and seemed very heavy for their size.
3. When ready to assemble cake bake your boxed cake according to instructions in a 9inch cake pan. When cool split the cake evenly down the middle. Place one half in a 9inch springform pan one used for cheesecakes and fill with your soaked cake pieces. Try to get this even as possible.
4. Place top layer over filling and cover with plastic wrap the plastic touching the top of the cake. I placed my cleaned cake pan over the top of this and weighed it down with jars from the fridge. The reason I did this was to make sure that the cake was flat number one but also I wanted some of the juice from the middle to seep into the top and bottom layer thereby binding the cake together.
5. Place in fridge overnight make sure its covered. The next day frost the top and cover with sprinkles."

2. On day four add to the starter 7 1/2 cups of flour 4 1/4 cups of water and 2 teaspoons of malt. Mix well cover and keep at room temperature for 24 hours. Repeat this process the next day BUT only let the dough sit for 5 hours then refrigerate it. Be aware that your starter will stay usable for 5 days. After this period you will have to refresh the starter by taking 2 pounds of the batter and starting again from day 4.
3. At last the starter is complete and now we can make the bread In a large bowl or in the bowl of a 5 quart stand mixer combine 2 1/2 cups of the starter 5 1/8 cups of bread flour 1 1/2 cups water 1/4 cup gluten 2 teaspoons malt and 4 teaspoons of salt. Mix everything together into a uniform dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until elastic about 15 minutes. In an electric mixer it should take about 9 minutes. For more experienced bread bakers the dough should pass the windowpane test Stretch the dough between your fingers till you have a very thin membrane if the dough is elastic enough the membrane will not break or tear apart. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
4. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into rounds. Cover again and let rest for 1 hour.
5. Grease any pans you wish to use. Give the loaves their final shape loaves baguettes or round and place onto the prepared pans. Let the loaves rise until double in size. Spritz with water occasionally to keep from drying. Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F 240 degrees C. Spray loaves generously with water.
6. Bake for about 45 minutes or until the loaf makes a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom. If after 20 minutes the loaves appear to be taking on too much color reduce the temperature to 425 degrees F 220 degrees C. After baking cool loaves on a wire rack. BON APPETIT"

1. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of flour over the butter and mix it together with your hands in a mixing bowl or on a work surface. Transfer the butter to a length of foil or parchment paper and pat it into a 6 inch square. Fold up the foil to make a packet and refrigerate until chilled about 2 hours.
2. Combine 2 cups of the flour with the salt and sugar in a mixing bowl. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water 100 degrees F/38 degrees C and set aside until frothy about 10 minutes. Meanwhile warm the milk and the heavy cream to lukewarm. Add the yeast milk and cream to the flour mixture and stir well. The dough will have a batterlike consistency.
3. Stir in the remaining 2 cups of flour 1/4 cup at a time to form a soft dough. It should no longer be sticky. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth about 5 minutes. Place the dough in a mixing bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
4. To begin the rolling and folding process both the butter and the dough should be at a cool room temperature. See Cook39s Note. Place the dough on a floured surface and roll it into a 10inch square. Set the block of butter diagonally on the square dough. Bring each point of dough to the center of the butter square the edges of the dough should overlap. Pinch the edges together to seal.
5. Starting from the center of the square and working outward use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle. The butter should be pliable enough to roll smoothly with the dough if it39s too soft and starts to ooze out the corners wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate before proceeding. Roll the dough into a long rectangle approximately 8 by 18 inches. Fold the length of dough into thirds like a business letter.
6. If the dough is still cool you can continue with another fold. Otherwise wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 45 minutes to 1 hour. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it warm up for about 10 minutes before you begin rolling it out again.
7. Position the dough so that the open ends are at 12 and 6 o39clock. Roll the dough into a rectangle working from the center of the dough and pressing outwards. Reposition the dough as necessary to fit your work space. You should have a long rectangle for the 34book fold.34 Fold both ends of the dough into the middle the ends don39t have to be touching but should be close. Fold the alreadyfolded dough in half it will look like a thick book. Wrap the dough well with plastic and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours.
8. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it rest at room temperature for about 20 minutes. Roll the dough into a rectangle again and fold it into thirds like a business letter. Wrap it in plastic and refrigerate for 46 hours or overnight.
9. To shape the croissants roll the dough into a 10 by 38inch rectangle on a lightly floured work surface. It should be about 1/4 inch thick. Use a pizza wheel or sharp paring knife to trim the edges of the dough. Divide the rectangle in half so that you have two 5inch wide strips of dough. Use a clean yardstick to mark each strip into triangles that are 5 inches wide at their bases. Cut the triangles and place them onto parchmentlined baking sheets. Chill for 15 to 20 minutes if necessary.
10. Starting at the base of the triangle roll the dough up into a log the tip of the triangle should be under the body of the croissant to prevent it from unraveling. Bend in the corners to form the traditional crescent shape. Repeat with the remaining dough.
11. Arrange the croissants on the parchmentlined baking sheets and allow to rise until doubled in size about 1 to 2 hours.
12. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F 220 degrees C. Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash. Brush the croissants with egg wash and bake in the preheated oven until deep brown 22 to 25 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving."

They will make an ideal pattern for cutting.
6. Score the surface sheet using a sharp knife. Make as many 2 inch cuts as necessary to ensure there will be at least two cuts per finished Danish once you carve up the sheet after baking. In other words if you plan to cut the sheet into 12 servings picture where you will make the horizontal and vertical cuts to make the 12 squares and score each of the 12 areas with small 2 inch cuts.
