4. You should have a messy wad of ingredients that you can get your hands into. Work all remaining flour into the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. If it39s obviously too dry make a small indent in the dough and add a couple tablespoons more water and work it inches If it39s too sticky toss a little flour on the surface and work it inches You can tell when it39s right if you pick it up by one side and it very slowly stretches on its own. It39s right when it feels really nice to work.
5. Now the fun part. Here39s where you get your therapy. Kneed the dough for a full five minutes. Fold it. Turn it. Push it. Punch it. Really work it. If you don39t cheat on this part you39ll have a really nice consistency in your bread.
6. After your five minutes of fun form it into a little mound cut an X in the top with a knife and pop it in an oiled bowl and cover with a damp towel. Let it sit in a warm place for 23 hours or until doubled in size.
7. Heat your oven to about 400F When dinner is about 30 minutes away turn your dough out on your work surface punch it down and kneed it for a minute. Divide it in half with a knife and form two mounds. Oil a cookie sheet or large baking tray. Stretch your dough into a 1618 inch round. It will be about inches thick. Don39t worry about getting it perfect. Just stretch it however you like.
8. Pop the first one in the oven for about 15 minutes or until golden. Remove the tray and turn the flat bread bottom up to cool just a bit. Form another round and bake the second one while you enjoy the first. You39ll need the second
9. You can slice this flat bread if you like but it39s much more fun if you just tear it apart This easy bread recipe goes great with stews soups salads beans meats pastas almost anything."

3. Knead the dough until it39s smooth in a bread machine set on the dough cycle about 2 minutes in a food processor 6 to 8 minutes by electric stand mixer or 8 to 10 minutes by hand. Put the dough in a greased bowl turn it over to coat the entire surface and cover the bowl. Let the dough rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until it increases in size by at least onethird.
4. Filling If you have a food processor use it it39s ideal for this filling. Cube the hard cheese add the soft cheese and process until wellmixed but some chunks remain. Add the eggs flour and seasonings and pulse just to mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use.
5. If you don39t have a food processor grate the hard cheese and beat in the soft cheese and eggs. Continue beating adding the flour and seasonings. Refrigerate until ready to use.
6. Shaping and Baking After the dough has risen turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough in half you39ll be making two loaves and cut a small 1ounce piece of dough off of each half. Round all four pieces of dough into balls and let them rest covered for 15 minutes.
7. Roll each large ball into a 10 to 12inch circle. Place one circle into a lightly greased small pie tin 8 or 9inch round cake pan or onto a lightly greased or parchmentlined baking sheet. Dollop half of the cheese mixture into the middle of the circle and pull the dough up around the cheese folding and pinching it and 34pleating34 it into a topknot. Leave a small hole in the very center of the knot and place the small ball in this hole. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Cover the loaves and let them rise for 45 minutes or longer they39ll look puffy but not doubled in size. If the pleats have opened pinch them shut.
8. Bake the loaves in a preheated 375F oven for 15 minutes then lower the temperature to 350F and bake for another 20 to 25 minutes. When finished the loaves will be golden brown and the middle should feel set. Tent the loaves with aluminum foil after 15 minutes if they seem to be browning too quickly. Remove the loaves from the oven and allow them to cool for at least 15 minutes before slicing. Slice the bread into wedges and serve it warm or at room temperature.
9. Heat milk until small bubbles form around the edge and the occasional wisp of steam is evident.
10. Cheese varies greatly in salt content so taste before adding salt."
